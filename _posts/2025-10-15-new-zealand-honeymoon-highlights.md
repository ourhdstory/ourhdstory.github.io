Our New Zealand honeymoon was everything we dreamed of and more - a perfect blend of adventure, relaxation, and breathtaking landscapes. Here's a recap of our incredible two-week journey through Middle Earth!

## Queenstown: Adventure Capital
We kicked off our honeymoon in Queenstown, the adventure capital of New Zealand. Our first day started with a bang - literally - as we went bungy jumping at the famous Kawarau Bridge. The adrenaline rush was unreal, and what better way to start our married life than by taking a leap of faith together?

## Milford Sound
The drive to Milford Sound was just as spectacular as the destination itself. We took a cruise through the fjord, watching waterfalls cascade down ancient cliff faces while seals lounged on rocks nearby. The overnight stay at the Milford Sound Lodge gave us a chance to see the stars in one of the world's darkest sky regions.

## Hobbiton and Rotorua
Being huge Lord of the Rings fans, we couldn't miss Hobbiton! The movie set tour was magical - we even had "second breakfast" at the Green Dragon Inn. Later, in Rotorua, we experienced Maori culture firsthand at a traditional hangi feast and cultural performance.

## Abel Tasman National Park
We spent three incredible days hiking and kayaking in Abel Tasman National Park. The crystal-clear waters, golden beaches, and lush forests were postcard-perfect. We spotted dolphins playing in the bay during our kayaking expedition!

## Wellington
Our final stop was the charming capital city of Wellington. We loved the vibrant cafe culture, rode the iconic cable car, and visited Te Papa museum. The craft beer scene here is amazing - we did a tasting tour of several local breweries.

## Memorable Moments
- Stargazing during a glacier hot pool experience at Franz Josef
- Spotting wild kiwi birds on a night walk in Stewart Island
- Wine tasting in Marlborough
- Helicopter landing on a glacier
- Stumbling upon a pod of orcas during our ferry crossing

New Zealand exceeded all our expectations. The people were incredibly friendly, the food was fantastic (especially the lamb and seafood), and the landscapes were unlike anything we'd ever seen. It was the perfect mix of adventure and romance - exactly what we wanted for our honeymoon.

The hardest part? Leaving! But we're already planning our return trip for our first anniversary...
