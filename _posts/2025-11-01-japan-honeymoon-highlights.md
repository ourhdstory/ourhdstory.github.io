Our first honeymoon adventure took us to **Japan**, where we explored cherry blossoms, temples, and some of the best food of our lives.  
From Kyoto’s peaceful shrines to Tokyo’s neon nights, it was the perfect start to our married life.  

Here are a few highlights:
- Watching the sunrise at Fushimi Inari
- Staying in a traditional ryokan with hot springs
- Visiting the Ghibli Museum
- Eating ramen every single day 🍜
